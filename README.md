Hello good people.


This is a collection of data science projects that I am working on.
The dataset is sourced from real datasets spread online or from various online training courses on the internet.
This is also my learning path in exploring the world of data science. My target is to try to complete at least 1 mini project / exercise every week to maintain my learning process.
